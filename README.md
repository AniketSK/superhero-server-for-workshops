A Server that provides information on superheroes via an api. Feel free to use it in your own projects.
Based on superheroapi.com and superherodb.com with changes to make it almost entirely local (only images are downloaded at runtime from the net).

To use:

Clone and start the server with:

node server.js

No npm install is required since pure node functions without any additional packages have been used.

To develop:

Only if you want to use jest to run the tests,

npm i

Then check out the existing tests and modify whatever you want.

To add a new feature, open an issue for discussion, always open to PR's :)
